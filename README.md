## Overview
The proposal is at the top of the folder called proposal.pdf


## Already Implemented Systems
1. 2D animation system that supports loops and different frame rates.
2. Data loader that reads JSON files and generates stage and creature classes.
3. A Collision Detection system that can return which side is collided.
4. Sprite renderer using Texture Mapping with OpenGL.
5. Stage manager that the player can interact with different connected stages.
6. Finite-State Machine for controlling player states, which also can easily extend new states.
7. Sound manager using bass.h
8. Deferred Key system for adding tolerance to player inputs.
9. Debug system for visualizing the collision range.
